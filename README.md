### Abstract
The main objective of developing this project is to efficiently handle loan management in banks. A loan management system is a digital platform that helps automate every stage of the loan lifecycle, from application to closing. The traditional loan management process is meticulous, time-consuming, and requires collecting and verifying information about applicants, their trustworthiness, and their credibility.
It consists of four main entities related to each other through relationships. This system can be used to insert details about bank executives, loans along with their reference numbers, payments which refer to each individual loan and borrowers along with their details.
